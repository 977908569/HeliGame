### FAQ

* **I can't load any map.**

I've set Git LFS for the \*.umap files and 'Maps' directory, so any file inside this directory will be also handled by Git LFS. You can delete their references and create new ones, with whatever content you want, with the same name (because names are referenced in the UI to load them), or you can download all the maps from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DDoriOtTO8zOk4SSCpm5EAK3m8ebFxaO and place them inside 'Content/Maps'.


* **I can't find any server.**

If you are not finding your friend server try to disable your firewall, make sure your friend has it disabled as well, and follow these instructions to connect directly using your friend IP address: After your friend start hosting a game match, in the game menu, press '=' to prompt the console command and type 'TravelToIP yourFriendIPaddress', then press enter/return and you should jump straight to your friend game session. 

* **Can I play it against my friends on the internet?**

Although the game still doesn't have any full integration with game services like Steam, you still can play Birds of War against your friends on the internet by using some **VPN** like **Hamachi**.
